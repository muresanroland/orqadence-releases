# On call

On call lets a run go on while you are away from the desk. Your phone rings when
a Question waits, and you answer it in the Shell over SSH.

## What On call does

When a Question has waited 5 minutes unanswered, the Shell goes On call and
rings your phone through [Moshi](https://getmoshi.app). The minutes are set on
the On call page of `/config`. When On call starts, every Question already
waiting, and every PR that MERGE TO UNBLOCK lists, is pushed once. While it is
on, every Question after it, every PR that joins MERGE TO UNBLOCK and the end
of the run are pushed to the phone at once. A PR joins MERGE TO UNBLOCK once
its Rebase and PR comments are done and a Ticket waits on its merge. The status
row shows ON CALL.

You answer in the Shell, from the phone over SSH. Answering any Question ends
On call. The next Question rings only after it has itself waited the minutes.

Nothing parks for On call: a Stage's question waits and rings. `/away` wins:
turning Away on ends On call, and under Away nothing rings and the Shell never
goes On call. On call is off each time the Shell opens, and stays off while it
has no token.

Nothing rings if the Mac sleeps or the Shell is closed: the Shell is what pushes.

## Moshi

1. Install the Moshi app on your phone.
2. In Moshi, open Settings > Notifications and copy the webhook token.
3. Give the token to Orqadence, one of two ways:
   - In the Shell, open `/config`, go to the On call page and type the token.
   - Set `MOSHI_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` in the environment the Shell runs in (wins over
     the saved token).
4. On the On call page of `/config`, pick "Send a test push". The phone should
   ring almost at once.

## Reaching the Shell

1. On the Mac, turn on Remote Login: System Settings > General > Sharing.
2. In Moshi, add the Mac as an SSH host: the user is your Mac login name, the
   password is its login password, the port is 22.
3. Connect and type `herdr`. It attaches to the running herdr session, where
   the Shell is. Answer the Question there.

Plain SSH is free in Moshi. mosh and Moshi's herdr integration need Moshi Pro;
you do not need either.

## Away from home

At home, Moshi reaches the Mac by its `.local` name or its LAN IP. Neither works
from anywhere else. Use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com):

1. Install Tailscale on the Mac and on the phone.
2. Put the phone on the same tailnet as the Mac: the same account, signed in
   with the same login provider. `tailscale status` on the Mac lists the phone
   as a peer when it is.
3. On the phone, turn on the VPN toggle in the Tailscale app.
4. In Moshi, set the host to the Mac's Tailscale IP or its MagicDNS name. The
   user, password and port stay the same.

## The token and the push

A token given to `orqa init` or `/config` is kept in
`.orqadence-local/config.json`, readable only by you.

A push says which Ticket waits and on what: its id, the kind of Question and the
Ticket's title, for example
`harness-bsg.4 · Plan to approve · Brainstorm loop: ...`. The Question's text
and its options never leave the Mac. A push that fails shows as a notice line
in the Shell; the run goes on.
