# Orqadence

Drives a beads epic through a fixed multi-agent pipeline, from tickets to open pull requests, with every agent visible in herdr.

## Language

**Orqadence**:
The globally installed tool as a whole: the Orchestrator and the Shell.

**Target repo**:
The repository whose epic is being worked on. Orqadence is run from inside it; it scaffolds the repo's agent setup once, and the repo owns its conventions from then on.
_Avoid_: Project, host repo

**Stage skill**:
A skill owned and shipped by Orqadence that holds the instructions for one Stage. Once installed for a Target repo, the installed copy is the one that runs and may be edited there.
_Avoid_: Prompt, template

**Brainstorm skill**:
A skill owned and shipped by Orqadence that holds the instructions for one kind of Brainstorm session, such as charting a Map or answering a Research Waypoint. Orqadence's own, modelled on mattpocock's wayfinder and the skills it calls; a Target repo changes a Brainstorm by editing the installed copy, not by swapping in another skill.
_Avoid_: Wayfinder, brainstorming skill

**Delegate skill**:
A skill, third-party or Shipped, a Stage skill or Brainstorm skill runs for one job (test-first implementing, self review, the over-engineering audit, merge conflicts, PR comments, how it writes...), chosen per job by the user: one Orqadence installed, the repo's own, one built into an App, or, once the user turns their personal skills on, one of their own at home or from a Claude Code plugin. A Stage can have several. The skill that runs it still owns its result; with no Delegate skill for a job it follows its own instructions. The Brainstorm's own jobs, grilling, domain modeling, research and prototyping, never take one.
_Avoid_: Override, replacement, work skill

**Shipped skill**:
Any skill Orqadence ships and installs for a Target repo, committed with the repo's Orqadence settings: the Stage skills, the Brainstorm skills, plus orqa-create-pr, which the Fix Stage and the Release run, orqa-infra-review, orqa:infra's Extra review skill, orqa-address-pr-comments, the Address PR comments Stage's default Delegate skill, orqa-manual-work, which says how a session files Manual work, and orqa-code-graph, which Implement loads to find its way through the worktree's code graph. Like every skill Orqadence installs, fetched Delegate skills too, its name starts with orqa-, so none shares a name with a skill of the repo's or the user's own.

**Personal override**:
One setting of the Target repo's Orqadence settings that one person keeps for themselves, read over the repo's committed value on their machine only. It never leaves the machine and is never reviewed, so it covers only what does not change the text a Stage runs: which App, model and effort a Stage uses, always the three together, and the run's caps and switches. Never a skill, a Delegate pick, a label or a secret. A Ticket's label still goes over it.
_Avoid_: Local config, user config, override file

**Skill manifest**:
The Target repo's record of the skills Orqadence installs for it: the Shipped skills, plus third-party skills named by their pinned source, and which of them is each Stage's Delegate skill. It belongs to the repo and is committed beside the skill files themselves, so every checkout runs the same text, and a new version of any skill reaches the repo only as a change someone reviews.
_Avoid_: Config, lockfile

**Epic**:
The beads epic handed to Orqadence. Its child Tickets are the whole scope of one run.

**Ticket**:
A beads issue, and the unit that moves through the Pipeline. Most are children of the Epic; a Ticket can also run in a Ticket run, whether it has an Epic or not. It ends as one pull request and closes only when that pull request is merged.
_Avoid_: Task, issue, story

**Ticket run**:
A run over Tickets the user names instead of an Epic: its scope is a queue they add to and take from while it runs, and it ends once every Ticket in it is merged (or none is left), after its Release when it carries the Release label. Like an Epic run it takes at most max_tickets at once, polls for merges and resumes; only one run, of either kind, is live in a Target repo.
_Avoid_: Batch, single-Ticket run

**Saved run**:
A run, an Epic run or a Ticket run, that was stopped before it ended, kept so it can go on later where it left off: each Ticket at its Stage. A Target repo keeps every Saved run until it ends, or until bd shows it over: an Epic run's Epic closed, or every Ticket of a Ticket run closed with no Release left unfinished. Each stopped Ticket run is a Saved run of its own. A Ticket belongs to one run at a time: whichever run takes it up, a Ticket run naming it or an Epic run over its Epic, takes it out of the Saved run that held it, at its Stage, so Tickets from several Saved runs, Epic runs included, can go on together in one run. Still, only one run is live at a time, so a Saved run resumes whole only while none is; its Tickets can join a live Ticket run.
_Avoid_: Stopped run, history entry, paused epic

**Ticket label**:
A bd label `orqa:<name>` that the Target repo has configured, changing how its Ticket runs: the skills and guidance the Stages that write its code get, the App, model or effort of any Stage, the template its pull request is written from, and possibly an Extra review. A Ticket carries at most one Area label and any number of Modifier labels; labels that clash are put to the user before the Ticket goes on. Its pull request carries the same labels on GitHub, where `orqa init` and `/config` keep them.
_Avoid_: Tag, kind

**Area label**:
The Ticket label naming the one type of work a Ticket does, such as fe, be, db, security, architecture or infra. Work that spans areas is an Epic with a Ticket per area, the Epic's description saying what each side expects of the other.
_Avoid_: Type (bd's issue type), domain

**Modifier label**:
A Ticket label that only changes which App, model or effort runs a Stage, such as codex-review, and combines with an Area label.
_Avoid_: Flag, option

**Human-merge label**:
A Ticket label configured `human_merge`, as security, db and infra ship, or the built-in `orqa:human-merge` on one Ticket: the Orchestrator never merges that Ticket's pull request, which carries the GitHub label `orqa:human-merge`, even under Agent merge.
_Avoid_: Protected label, manual label

**No-review label**:
The built-in Modifier `orqa:no-review` on one Ticket: its Review, Extra review and Debate are skipped, Implement followed by a Fix that opens the pull request, which is a No-review pull request. It is independent of a Human-merge label: a Ticket carrying both gets a pull request nothing reviews and a human merges.
_Avoid_: Skip-review label, docs label

**Release label**:
The label `orqa:release`, on an Epic or on any Ticket of a Ticket run, asking that the run end in a Release, when the Target repo has releases turned on. The bump comes from the Release template: by default an Epic's run raises the minor version, a Ticket run the patch version; the Breaking label makes it the major. Unlike a Ticket label it is read on the Epic, not its Tickets, and changes how the run ends, not how a Ticket runs; on GitHub only the Release's version pull request carries it.
_Avoid_: Version bump label, release tag

**Breaking label**:
The label `orqa:breaking`, read where the Release label is (on the Epic, never its Tickets, or on any Ticket of a Ticket run) when the Release starts: the Release raises the major version, X.Y.Z to X+1.0.0, whatever the Release template's bump says. It marks a change users must act on to upgrade; on GitHub the version pull request of a major bump carries it.
_Avoid_: Major label, semver label

**Brainstorm**:
Planning work with the user before it is built: one session turns the user's idea into Tickets, or into a Map when the work is big. A Map's Waypoints then get a session each, the ones that need the user one after another, the Research Waypoints alongside, until the Waypoint that writes the Epic closes.
_Avoid_: Wayfinding, grilling, planning run

**Idea**:
The beads issue a Brainstorm opens for the user's idea the moment charting starts, in progress while it is charted, so a stopped charting can be found and continued. Once charting ends it closes, naming the Map or the Tickets that came out; it never enters the Pipeline.
_Avoid_: Start ticket, brainstorm ticket

**Map**:
The beads epic a Brainstorm charts: where the work is headed, the decisions made so far, and the Waypoints still open. Its last Waypoint writes the Epic that builds what it decided.
_Avoid_: Brainstorm epic, wayfinder epic, coding epic (that is the Epic)

**Waypoint**:
One question on a Map, closed by the decision recorded on it rather than by a pull request. It never enters the Pipeline.
_Avoid_: Map ticket, Ticket, decision ticket

**Research Waypoint**:
A Waypoint answered by research alone, needing no user, so Orqadence runs it in its own session while the user works another Waypoint or is Away; the next session with the user reads what it found. Only research runs without the user; anything needing a credential or a human action is Manual work.
_Avoid_: Background Waypoint, Background Map ticket, AFK ticket (AFK is avoided for Away), unattended ticket

**Pipeline**:
The fixed sequence of Stages every Ticket passes through: Implement, Review, Debate, Fix, then a pull request, plus an Extra review when its Area label carries one.
_Avoid_: Workflow, flow

**Extra review**:
A second review an Area label adds to its Tickets, with its own skill, App, model and effort: the Review's instructions with the label's own review skill, such as a security review or infra's offline checks. As the label says, it runs after the Review in every Round, in the first Round only, or once after the last Round before the pull request, and its Findings join the Debate or go straight to the Fix. Like the Review it never changes the code, and a Round opened unreviewed skips it too.
_Avoid_: Extra Stage, label Stage, security Stage

**Round**:
One pass of Review, Debate and Fix over a Ticket, with any Extra review beside the Review. With no Findings to argue the Debate does not run, and an empty Verdict stands in its place. Rounds repeat until a Verdict has no fix items or the cap is reached, after which the pull request opens with any leftover Findings listed.
_Avoid_: Iteration, loop, cycle

**Stage**:
One step of the Pipeline, carried out by a fresh agent session in its own pane.
_Avoid_: Step, phase

**App**:
An agent CLI a Stage can run on, such as claude or codex, picked per Stage by the user. Each App starts its own sessions, reads the Target repo's skills, and has its own usage limits.
_Avoid_: Agent, kind, CLI, provider

**Stage result**:
The recorded outcome of a Stage, carrying its completion status and, as appropriate, Findings, a Verdict, an opened pull request, a Plan to approve, or a question the Stage needs the user to answer before it can go on. The Orchestrator uses it together with the session's state to decide whether the Stage can advance.

**Run directory**:
The Ticket's directory under `.orqadence-local/runs/`, holding its Stages' evidence: the result files, diffs and Debate transcripts, all flat text. It doubles as the Review's sandbox, so build scratch lands there too, and the last Fix's screenshots wait in its `pr/` folder to be attached; both are pruned when the pull request opens. Address PR comments puts its new captures of an orqa:fe Ticket's screens there again.
_Avoid_: Logs, workdir, artifacts

**Finding**:
One claimed problem with a Ticket's changes, raised by the Review, an Extra review or the over-engineering audit, and the unit the Debate argues over.
_Avoid_: Comment, issue, point

**PR comment**:
What a reviewer, human or bot, leaves on a Ticket's pull request once it is open: a review thread, or a finding in a review's body or a bot's summary. The Address PR comments Stage acts on them. Unlike a Finding, it comes from outside Orqadence.
_Avoid_: Finding (that is Orqadence's own Review), feedback

**Rebase**:
The Stage that brings a Ticket's open pull request back onto the default branch when it conflicts, keeping both sides' intent or asking the user. It runs outside the Pipeline, by itself when the Target repo turns it on, and otherwise on the user's command.
_Avoid_: Address, conflict fix, merge

**Address PR comments**:
The Stage that acts on a Ticket's open pull request once its checks and bots are done: it fixes the PR comments and failing checks the user approved, answers one that asks for the work of another open Ticket of the run or its Epic as covered by that Ticket, answers the others as won't fix, and pushes to the same pull request. It runs outside the Pipeline, after the user approves or a countdown or Away approves for them.
_Avoid_: Address (alone), Fix (that is the Pipeline's), review response

**Agent merge**:
The Target repo's switch, off by default and only with automatic Address PR comments on, that lets the Orchestrator merge a Ticket's pull request once Address PR comments' flow has finished on a quiet head: checks green, the repo's review bots done, and every PR comment fixed or answered. Anything still open, or a listed bot that has not reviewed within `bot_wait`, is a Question: merge or park, and for the bot keep waiting. Never for a Human-merge label; never by a Stage session.
_Avoid_: Auto-merge (GitHub's), self-merge

**No-review pull request**:
The Release's version pull request, a Settings pull request, a Ticket's whose Ticket carries the No-review label, or one whose every changed file is Markdown or a skill, Human-merge or not. It carries the GitHub label `orqa:no-review`, which the review bots are configured to skip, and under Agent merge it merges once its checks are green, unless a human must merge it.
_Avoid_: Trivial PR, docs PR

**Settings pull request**:
The No-review pull request the Shell opens when the user agrees to commit what a /config save wrote to the Target repo: only those settings, put onto the default branch as it stands, never the checkout's other changes. One is open in a Target repo at a time, whoever opened it; a later one waits for it to merge or close. It belongs to no run: under Agent merge the Shell merges it, not the Orchestrator, and once it merges the checkout's matching uncommitted settings are dropped when no run is live, so a pull brings them back.
_Avoid_: Config PR, settings commit

**Release**:
The Stage that ends a run carrying the Release label, once every Ticket is merged. No session runs it: the Orchestrator itself, by the Release template, raises the version in each of the repo's version files, runs its lock command, adds a changelog entry when the repo keeps a changelog, and opens the version pull request. When that is merged, a Question asks whether to tag the new version; yes pushes the tag, and either answer ends the run. Under Agent merge the version pull request is merged and tagged without the Question. A repo that keeps its version only in tags gets no pull request, only the Question. It runs outside the Pipeline and belongs to the run, not to a Ticket.
_Avoid_: Version bump, bump, publish

**Release template**:
The `release` object of `.orqadence/config.json`, the repo's own and never a Personal override: the files the Target repo keeps its version in, each with the pattern that finds it, the command that refreshes its lockfile, its changelog's path, heading and entry, the tag's form and what an Epic run and a Ticket run each raise. `orqa init` detects it from the repo's files and never creates a changelog; /config's Release page edits it.
_Avoid_: Release config, version settings

**Moderator**:
The neutral session that runs the Debate between side A and side B. It never argues a position of its own, and settles Findings the sides still dispute by an outside score.
_Avoid_: Judge, Debby

**Verdict**:
The Debate's result: every Finding marked fix or skip, with a severity and the reason. A high Finding is never debated and is always fix. Only fix items reach the Fix Stage, with any Extra review Findings that skip the Debate.
_Avoid_: Synthesis, summary, report

**Epic summary**:
The Shell's read-only page over one run, an Epic's or a Ticket run's: each Ticket's pull request, Rounds and Findings fixed, skipped and left on the pull request, then the Parked Tickets with their reasons and the Manual work not yet done, with the run's cost and time. It opens by itself once every Ticket's pull request is merged or settled, or the Ticket Parked (settled: the poll found it done, its review cycles and fixes over, and only a human merges it, as it is human-merge or Agent merge is off), or, for a run carrying the Release label, only once its Release ends, then naming the new version; /summary opens it again, built fresh from bd, the state file and the Run directories.
_Avoid_: Report, recap

**Brainstorm summary**:
The Shell's page at the end of a Brainstorm, once the Waypoint that writes the Epics closes: each Epic in build order with its Tickets and their labels, then the Manual work not yet done. It offers to start the first Epic, but only once the docs pull request is merged and no other run is going; /summary @<map> opens it again.
_Avoid_: Map summary, Brainstorm report

**Wake**:
The Orchestrator's request for judgment about a Stage that cannot advance by rule, answered by a Judgment or, failing that, by the user through a Question.
_Avoid_: Alert, escalation

**Nudge**:
One canned prompt sent into a woken Stage's live session, at most once per session, by a Judgment or the user's answer: **write the result**, when the work is done but the result file is not, or **carry on**, when the session stopped to ask and nobody will answer, so it decides for itself.
_Avoid_: Continue (that is /continue-epic and /continue-ticket, resuming a Saved run, or /continue-brainstorm, resuming a Brainstorm), poke, reminder

**Judgment**:
The Orchestrator's answer to a Wake or a Plan, taken from a typed model over the evidence: for a Wake one of a fixed set of actions with a score each, for a Plan a yes or no score on each criterion (it covers the Ticket, it stays in scope, it asks the user a question), and under Agent merge, while the user is Away, a yes or no score on merging a pull request with its PR comments still open. It is acted on at or above a confidence floor, a Wake's and a Plan's each kept in config.json, the merge's the Wake's, and shown on the Shell.
_Avoid_: LLM call, Main session

**Plan**:
What an Implement session writes before it may edit: the changes and tests it intends for its Ticket, the decisions it made with the answer taken, and an open question only when it has one. A Judgment approves it when it covers every acceptance criterion, stays in scope and asks nothing; otherwise the user reads it and answers, and the session revises it. An open question always goes to the user; while they are Away it parks its Ticket until they unpark it.

**Question**:
What the Shell puts to the user when the Orchestrator cannot act alone: a Wake the Judgment was unsure about, a blocked session, a plan to approve, a Stage's own question, a pick not yet merged on a Ticket's base or a personal skill shadowing a committed one when the Ticket starts, an Extra review skill's fetch.sh that failed, Manual work its session waits on, the Review's App at its usage limit, a Brainstorm's session with the user at its usage limit, the Release's tag, its version pull request closed unmerged, its lock command that failed or a change besides its own files, under Agent merge a pull request left with PR comments open or a listed review bot silent, or a confirmation. It holds only its Ticket (the Review's limit, every Ticket reaching the Review on that App until it is answered), is answered from a fixed set of options or a line of the user's own text, and is never saved: on resume it is derived again from the live session or the Stage result.
_Avoid_: Prompt, dialog, alert, form, popup

**Parked**:
A Ticket taken out of the Pipeline to wait for the user, after a Wake that a Judgment or the user settled as park, or after its Stage, its start or a failed fetch.sh asked a question, or its Stage filed Manual work it waits on, while the user was Away. Other Tickets keep running. Parked from Rebase or Address PR comments, it keeps its pull request, still polled for its merge, and unparking takes it back to that Stage, never to the Pipeline. Parked because GitHub refused the Orchestrator's merge, it keeps its pull request the same way, and unparking has the merge tried again. Parked by the merge Question, or by its Judgment while the user was Away, it keeps its pull request too, and unparking asks again. A Research Waypoint whose session needs the user while they are Away is parked the same way, and the other research goes on. The user unparks a Ticket of the live run with /unpark-ticket, its next Question then going ahead of the others; once its run is stopped, continuing the Saved run takes it back still Parked, and naming it in /continue-ticket unparks it.
_Avoid_: Stuck, paused, failed

**Manual work**:
Something a code-editing Stage or a Brainstorm session needs done that it cannot do itself, above all anything that needs a credential, filed for the user as written steps plus, as the task needs, a wizard to run or a prompt for a separate session outside Orqadence. When the session cannot go on without it, its Ticket or Waypoint waits on a Question until the user marks it done; otherwise the work goes on, the pull request lists it, and it stays open until the user marks it done. Unlike a Question, it asks for an action, not an answer.
_Avoid_: Manual step, human task, hand-off

**Away**:
What the user declares in the Shell when nobody will answer for a while, such as overnight. A Stage's question, Manual work a Stage waits on, a Plan's open question, one at a Ticket's start or one on a failed fetch.sh, then parks its Ticket instead of waiting, and is put to the user when they unpark that Ticket; the Release's, with no Ticket to park, wait. Nothing is pushed to the phone, and the Shell never goes On call. Under Agent merge a Judgment answers the merge Question in the user's place. Nothing else changes: Judgments still answer what they can.
_Avoid_: AFK, offline, unattended mode

**On call**:
What the Shell turns on by itself when a Question has waited five minutes unanswered and the user is not Away: they are away from the desk but their phone reaches them. That Question, every Question after it, each PR whose merge would unblock a Ticket once its Rebase and PR comments are done, and the end of the run are pushed to the phone at once, and the user answers in the Shell. Answering any Question ends it, from wherever it was typed. Unlike Away, nothing parks for it.
_Avoid_: Away by phone, remote mode, paged

**Limited**:
A Ticket held because the App its Stage runs on hit its provider's usage limit. The limit holds every Stage on that App, whichever Ticket it belongs to: a short one resumes at the reset; a long one (a reset more than a day away) ends the run with every session saved, a Saved run, and continuing it resumes each where it stopped. A limit on the Review is put to the user once, through a Question whose answer stands for every Ticket until the reset, except a Ticket carrying orqa:codex-review, which waits it out like any Stage; a limit on one Debate side settles the Findings without that side. A Brainstorm keeps its limits in its own state: its session with the user at a limit asks whether to pause (the Brainstorm is Limited, its session told to continue at the reset) or stop (saved, /continue-brainstorm @<map> resumes the session); a Research Waypoint holds as a Stage does, no new research starting on that App until the reset, and a long limit parks it, saved, for /continue-brainstorm @<map>. Unlike Parked, nothing in the Ticket's own work went wrong.
_Avoid_: Rate-limited, cooling down, throttled

**Ticket tab**:
The herdr tab belonging to one running Ticket, holding one pane per Stage.

**Docs pass**:
graphify's LLM pass over a Target repo's docs and images, which adds what they say to the code graph Orqadence keeps current on its own. It runs only when a new major or minor version tag reaches the default branch and the user says yes to the Question, in an App's session they can watch.
_Avoid_: Rebuild, graph build, reindex

**Tools**:
The one seam every external command (herdr, bd, gh, git) goes through; a test double stands behind it so tests never start a process.
_Avoid_: Runner, exec, shell

**Orchestrator**:
The deterministic process that owns ticket state, pane placement, and stage transitions. Its only judgment calls are bounded, logged Judgments through a typed model, and it never composes text.
_Avoid_: Script, runner, daemon

**Shell**:
The full-terminal screen that `orqa` alone opens: it lists the Epics and the open Tickets with no Epic, takes slash commands, runs the Orchestrator inside its own process, and is where every event and Question appears.
_Avoid_: TUI, dashboard, Main session, attach
